# GetMyStats - A Project By Kimberly Benson

## What is GetMyStats?
GetMyStats is a project made using a combination of Flask, HTML, and CSS to get a user's Spotify data such as top artists and public playlists.

## How Does GetMyStats Work?
1. A user logins in with their Spotify account. This uses their OAuth 2.0 protocols, and from there, reads the user data into multiple different variables separated by the type of data (playlists, artists).
2. The user data is rendered onto an html file, where everything is displayed. It uses a combination of Boostrap 5 and my own CSS to make it look appealing.

## What Is Next For GetMyStats?
1. Cleaning up the code, because right now a lot of the code is kind of a mess due to me needing to frequently play around with things.
2. Allow the user to get song recommendations
3. Come up with a better name
4. Add a dark mode
